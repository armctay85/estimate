# EstiMate Codebase Backup - Pre-Rectification
Date: July 15, 2025

## Backup Status
Complete source code exported to COMPLETE_SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.tsx (60KB, 1,898 lines)

## Current State
- Authentication: bcrypt + Passport.js operational
- Payments: Stripe integration with placeholder prices
- BIM Processing: Forge API with simulated extraction
- AI Services: X AI (Grok-2) integrated
- Testing: Jest + Playwright coverage
- Frontend: React components operational

## Issues to Fix (From Grok Audit)
1. Forge Viewer Quality - Add high-quality frontend viewer
2. BIM Extraction - Replace simulation with real extraction
3. Stripe Prices - Use real Stripe price IDs
4. Security Hardening - CSP and HTTPS enforcement
5. AI Accuracy Claims - Remove unsubstantiated claims
6. Frontend Navigation - Complete React components
7. Testing Coverage - Expand to 90%+
8. Performance Optimization - Add caching and large file support

## Next Steps
Execute rectification plan to achieve 100% production readiness.
