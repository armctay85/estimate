# Forge API Fix Summary - January 19, 2025

## Issue 1: "Legacy endpoint is deprecated" Error ✅ FIXED

### Root Cause
Autodesk deprecated the PUT endpoint for direct file uploads. The API now requires a multi-step process using signed S3 URLs.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Changed Upload Method** (server/forge-api.ts):
   - From: `PUT /oss/v2/buckets/{bucket}/objects/{object}`
   - To: Three-step S3 signed URL process

2. **New Upload Flow**:
   ```typescript
   // Step 1: Get signed URLs for multi-part upload
   GET /oss/v2/buckets/{bucket}/objects/{object}/signeds3upload?parts={n}
   
   // Step 2: Upload directly to S3
   PUT {signedUrl} (for each part)
   
   // Step 3: Complete the upload
   POST /oss/v2/buckets/{bucket}/objects/{object}/signeds3upload
   ```

3. **Multi-part Support**: 
   - Files split into 5MB chunks
   - Parallel uploads to S3
   - 94MB file uploads in 19 parts

## Issue 2: "Invalid 'design' parameter" Translation Error ✅ FIXED

### Root Cause
Double URN encoding - the objectId from upload is already a URN, but code was encoding it again.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed URN Generation** (server/forge-api.ts):
   ```typescript
   // Before (WRONG):
   const urn = Buffer.from(`${bucketKey}/${objectName}`).toString('base64');
   
   // After (CORRECT):
   const urn = objectId; // objectId is already proper URN format
   ```

2. **Fixed Translation Job**:
   ```typescript
   // Proper base64 encoding for translation API
   const base64Urn = Buffer.from(urn).toString('base64').replace(/=/g, '');
   ```

## Issue 3: Server Timeout on Long Translations ✅ FIXED

### Root Cause
Server held connection open for 20+ minutes during translation, causing 502 errors.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Immediate Response** (server/forge-api.ts):
   - Start translation and return immediately
   - Don't wait for completion in upload endpoint

2. **Client-Side Polling** (BIMUploadModal.tsx):
   - Poll `/api/forge/status/{urn}` every 30 seconds
   - Show progress to user during translation

### Test Results
- **File**: Snowdon Towers Sample Architectural.rvt (94.69 MB)
- **Upload**: Success in ~2 minutes
- **Translation**: Success after 124 attempts (~20 minutes)
- **Status**: Fully operational ✅

### Business Impact
- ✅ $44.985M pipeline unblocked
- ✅ Upload functionality fully restored
- ✅ Platform stability improved

## Issue 4: Navigation After Translation ✅ FIXED (January 19, 2025)

### Root Cause
No way to view model after translation completes - user stuck in upload modal.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Added View Model Button** (BIMUploadModal.tsx):
   - Green button appears when translation completes
   - Navigates to `/bim-viewer?urn={urn}`
   - Closes modal and opens dedicated viewer page

2. **Created BIM Viewer Page** (bim-viewer.tsx):
   - New route at `/bim-viewer`
   - Reads URN from URL parameters
   - Displays ForgeViewer component
   - Back to Dashboard navigation

## Issue 5: Performance Optimizations ✅ IMPLEMENTED (January 19, 2025)

### Based on Grok AI Recommendations
Implemented safe optimizations that don't break existing functionality.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **API Translation Parameters** (server/forge-api.ts):
   - Changed from `svf2` to `svf` format (faster translation)
   - Limited views to only `3d` (skip 2D views)
   - Disabled `generateMasterViews` (skip unnecessary processing)

2. **User Guidance** (BIMUploadModal.tsx):
   - Added pro tip for RVT optimization
   - Recommends purging unused elements and auditing in Revit
   - Can reduce file size by 30-40% before upload

3. **Polling Interval** (BIMUploadModal.tsx):
   - Reduced from 30 seconds to 15 seconds
   - Faster feedback when translation completes
   - Updated time calculations to match

### Performance Impact
- SVF format alone can reduce translation time significantly
- Skipping 2D views and master views further reduces processing
- User guidance helps reduce file size before upload
- Faster polling provides better user experience
