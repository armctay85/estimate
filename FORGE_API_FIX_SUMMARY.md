# Forge API Fix Summary - Legacy Endpoint Deprecated

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED
The Autodesk Forge API deprecated the legacy file upload endpoint, causing "Legacy endpoint is deprecated" errors.

## Implementation Status: 100% Complete
- Updated `server/forge-api.ts` ✅
- Updated `server/forge-real-integration.ts` ✅
- Fixed incorrect POST method - now uses GET for signed URLs ✅
- Implemented multi-part upload for files > 5MB ✅

## What Changed
**OLD METHOD (Deprecated)**:
```
PUT /oss/v2/buckets/{bucket}/objects/{object}
```

**NEW METHOD (S3 Multi-Part Signed URLs)**:
1. Request signed URLs: `GET /signeds3upload?parts={n}&firstPart={x}`
2. Upload chunks to S3: `PUT {signedUrl}` (5MB chunks)
3. Complete upload: `POST /signeds3upload`

## Key Fixes Applied
- Changed from POST to GET for requesting signed URLs (critical fix)
- Added multi-part upload support with 5MB chunks
- Proper query parameters: parts, firstPart, minutesExpiration
- Handles uploadKey for subsequent part requests
- Progress logging for each uploaded part

## Technical Details
- Supports files up to 500MB
- 60-minute URL expiration
- Backwards compatible URN generation
- Automatic chunking for files > 5MB
- Performance maintained for large files

## Files Modified
1. `server/forge-api.ts` - Main Forge API service
2. `server/forge-real-integration.ts` - Real Forge integration service
3. `replit.md` - Updated documentation

The platform now uses Autodesk's latest S3 multi-part upload approach with correct GET requests.
