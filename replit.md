2. Passport.js validates credentials against PostgreSQL
3. Session is created and stored in database
4. Frontend receives user object and subscription details
5. UI adapts based on user's subscription tier

### Payment Flow
1. User selects subscription tier on `/subscribe` page
2. Stripe Payment Element handles payment collection
3. Webhook processes successful payments
4. User subscription tier is updated in database
5. Feature access is immediately available
