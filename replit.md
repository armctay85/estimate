# BuildCost Sketch - Replit Project Guide

## Overview

BuildCost Sketch is a web-based mini take-off tool for property and construction projects in Australia. The application allows users to sketch simple floor plans, assign floor materials to rooms, and get quick cost estimates for renovation projects. It features a freemium model with basic functionality for free users and advanced features for paid subscribers.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI/UX Preferences: User prefers cleaner, more professional interface design and typography. Requested complete app code export and strategy summary for external review.
Performance Requirements: CRITICAL - Upload speeds must be near-instant (2-5 seconds maximum). User has stated "unless you can fix for close to instant upload speed - then not worth it". This is a make-or-break feature.
Quality Standards: MANDATORY - Every new component or feature must be systematically tested for:
- All buttons function correctly (especially close buttons)
- All navigation works as designed
- No broken functionality or non-working elements
- 100% execution quality - no shortcuts or watered-down implementations
- User should never have to remind about testing basic functionality

2. Passport.js validates credentials against PostgreSQL
3. Session is created and stored in database
4. Frontend receives user object and subscription details
5. UI adapts based on user's subscription tier

### Payment Flow
1. User selects subscription tier on `/subscribe` page
2. Stripe Payment Element handles payment collection
3. Webhook processes successful payments
4. User subscription tier is updated in database
5. Feature access is immediately available
