## Executive Summary
Successfully addressed critical navigation and functionality issues across the EstiMate platform based on user's comprehensive audit and instructions. All fixes maintain enterprise-grade standards while ensuring instant performance.

## Fixed Issues

- Proper integration with canvas uploadBackground

### 3. Dashboard Card Verification ✓

## Technical Implementation

### Modal Pattern
For components with shadcn Dialog issues, implemented direct modal pattern:
```jsx
{showComponent && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 z-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4">
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg max-w-2xl w-full max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
      <Component />
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### Navigation Pattern  
Consistent use of wouter's useLocation hook:
```jsx
const [, navigate] = useLocation();
// Then use: navigate('/path')
```
